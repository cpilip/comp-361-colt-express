### Tasks missed, scheduled for this report
 * No task missed, everything is good so far.

### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report
 * The problem of figuring out the relation of use cases: how to relate the chat, setting, pause and load game use cases in the game to other use cases
 * The problem of how to group those small and similar use cases into a big use case. (For example: Start Game and Modify Setting should belong to Game Lobby Use Cases)
 * Hard to figure out all the use cases that need to be done, always missing some small use cases.

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report
 * We should do a list of all the use cases when we design each page
 * We need to discuss more details about this game
 * We should left more time to do the project

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)
